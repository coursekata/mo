# `mo`: Methodically Organize CourseKata Data

This repository contains the `mo` package, which is used to methodically organize data downloaded from [CourseKata](https://coursekata.org/) classes. The general idea is that you download the data from CourseKata, and then use `mo` to organize it into a format that is easier to work with.

## Installation

`mo` is not yet available via `pip`, but you can install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/coursekata/mo
```
